# What is NuGetForUnity?

NuGetForUnity is a NuGet client built from scratch to run inside the Unity Editor. NuGet is a package management system which makes it easy to create packages that are distributed on a server and consumed by users. NuGet supports [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) for packages as well as dependencies on other packages.

You can learn more about NuGet here: [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/)
